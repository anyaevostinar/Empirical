  abstract = {We present SignalGP, a new genetic programming (GP) technique designed to incorporate the event-driven programming paradigm into computational evolution's toolbox. Event-driven programming is a software design philosophy that simplifies the development of reactive programs by automatically triggering program modules (event-handlers) in response to external events, such as signals from the environment or messages from other programs. SignalGP incorporates these concepts by extending existing tag-based referencing techniques into an event-driven context. Both events and functions are labeled with evolvable tags; when an event occurs, the function with the closest matching tag is triggered. In this work, we apply SignalGP in the context of linear GP. We demonstrate the value of the event-driven paradigm using two distinct test problems (an environment coordination problem and a distributed leader election problem) by comparing SignalGP to variants that are otherwise identical, but must actively use sensors to process events or messages. In each of these problems, rapid interaction with the environment or other agents is critical for maximizing fitness. We also discuss ways in which SignalGP can be generalized beyond our linear GP implementation.},

    abstract = "{The emergence of new replicating entities from the union of simpler entities characterizes some of the most profound events in natural evolutionary history. Such transitions in individuality are essential to the evolution of the most complex forms of life. Thus, understanding these transitions is critical to building artificial systems capable of open-ended evolution. Alas, these transitions are challenging to induce or detect, even with computational organisms. Here, we introduce the DISHTINY (Distributed Hierarchical Transitions in Individuality) platform, which provides simple cell-like organisms with the ability and incentive to unite into new individuals in a manner that can continue to scale to subsequent transitions. The system is designed to encourage these transitions so that they can be studied: Organisms that coordinate spatiotemporally can maximize the rate of resource harvest, which is closely linked to their reproductive ability. We demonstrate the hierarchical emergence of multiple levels of individuality among simple cell-like organisms that evolve parameters for manually designed strategies. During evolution, we observe reproductive division of labor and close cooperation among cells, including resource-sharing, aggregation of resource endowments for propagules, and emergence of an apoptosis response to somatic mutation. Many replicate populations evolved to direct their resources toward low-level groups (behaving like multicellular individuals), and many others evolved to direct their resources toward high-level groups (acting as larger-scale multicellular individuals).}",

    abstract = { In the last decade, agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) has been applied to a variety of domains, demonstrating the potential of this technique to advance science, engineering, and policy analysis. However, realizing the full potential of ABMS to find breakthrough research results requires far greater computing capability than is available through current ABMS tools. The Repast for High Performance Computing (Repast HPC) project addresses this need by developing a useful and useable next-generation ABMS system explicitly focusing on larger-scale distributed computing platforms. Repast HPC is intended to smooth the path from small-scale simulations to large-scale distributed simulations through the use of a Logo-like system. This articleâ€™s contribution is its detailed presentation of the implementation of Repast HPC as a useful and usable framework, a complete ABMS platform developed explicitly for larger-scale distributed computing systems that leverages modern C++ techniques and the ReLogo language. }

abstract = {Promoting diversity in an evolving population is important for Evolutionary Computation (EC) because it reduces premature convergence on suboptimal fitness peaks while still encouraging both exploration and exploitation [3]. However, some types of diversity facilitate finding global optima better than other types. For example, a high mutation rate may maintain high population-level diversity, but all of those genotypes are clustered in a local region of a fitness landscape. Fitness sharing [3], on the other hand, promotes diversity via negative density dependence forcing solutions apart. Lexicase selection [5] goes one step further, dynamically selecting for diverse phenotypic traits, encouraging solutions to actively represent many portions of the landscape.},
