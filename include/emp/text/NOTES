 * 
 *  Internal format is .emp, which uses just a backquote (`) as a special character.  It
 *  is otherwise heavily inspired from markdown, but makes special characters less tricky
 *  to use in your writing.
 *  
 *  The following tags toggle a formatting style.
 * 
 *  `*Bold!`*
 *  ``Code``
 *  `/Italic`/
 *  `_Underlined!`_
 *  `^Superscript`^
 *  `.Subscript`.
 *  `~Strikethrough`~
 * 
 *  The following tags grab the rest of the line they are on.  These should generally
 *  be the first non-whitespace on a line, but if they are not a newline will be assumed
 *  to be before them.
 * 
 *  `# Heading level 1
 *  `## Heading level 2
 *  `### etc.
 *  `" Blockquote
 *  `- Bulleted list entry
 *  `+ Numbered list entry
 *  `| Continues the previous line for other tags in this group.
 *  `% Comment that will be removed.
 * 
 *  `[Include a link name here](http://and.its.url.here)
 *  `<http://just.a.url.here>
 *  `![Link/to/image/here.jpg](with an optional URL link)
 * 
 *  Now for the crazy.  We can embed code as needed.
 * 
 *  `$variable = value || other_code`$
 *  `#var_value_printed_here#
 * 
 *  Anything with four spaces at the beginning will be treated like indented code.
 *  Add a `= at the beginning of a line if you don't want special formatting.
 *   
 *  A single or double backtick indicates that everything in between is going to be inline
 *  code.  A single backtick must be followed by an alphanumeric character or whitespace,
 *  but a double backtick can be followed by anything.
 * 
 *  `This would be rendered as CODE`
 *  ``{This would also be code}``
 * 
 *  Escape characters do work.
 *  \\ is \
 *  \` is a backtick in the actual string
 *  \n is newline
 *  \t is a tab
